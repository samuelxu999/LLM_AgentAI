# Doraemon and Super Saiyan: Battle of Time and Space

On an ordinary afternoon, Nobita was still sitting in front of his desk in a daze, with his homework piled up like a mountain, and he didn't even touch the first page. Doraemon was flipping through comics, sighing from time to time, thinking that this child was still as unreliable as ever. Just as their lives were going on as usual, a strong light suddenly fell from the sky, and the whole room shook. A blond boy walked out of the light, wearing armor and with amazing momentum. He was the Super Saiyan from the future - Trunks. As soon as he appeared, he said something amazing: the future earth will be destroyed by dark forces, and he came here to seek Doraemon's help.

Doraemon and Nobita were shocked, but they also read Trunks's firm eyes and determination. Trunks explained that the enemy in the future is not an ordinary villain, but a being called "Dark Saiyan". He was copied and modified by evil scientists from Vegeta's genes, and his strength is beyond imagination. This enemy not only has the fighting power of Saiyans, but can also manipulate the distorted time energy, making him almost invincible. Trunks has fought alone for many years, but each time ended in a miserable defeat. He said: "Technology is the only weapon missing in my era, and you just have it."

So, Doraemon, Trunks and Nobita started the time machine and traveled to the future world that was about to collapse. The scene in front of them was shocking: the city was reduced to ruins, the earth was full of cracks, and the sky was filled with oppressive black fog. Trunks said that this was the result of the Dark Saiyans. Almost all life was wiped out, and only he was left struggling to support it. Although Nobita was terrified, he gradually became motivated when he saw innocent people suffering. Doraemon calmly analyzed the situation and decided to use his three most powerful secret props to fight against the dark forces.

The three secret items are: the "Copy Cloak" that can temporarily grant super combat power, the "Time Stop Watch" that can pause time for five seconds, and the "Portable Version of the Spirit and Time House" that can complete a year of training in one minute. Nobita was pushed into the spirit house and received intensive training. Although there were only a few minutes of real time, he experienced a whole year of hard training. At first he was still weak and wanted to give up and run away, but when he thought of Shizuka, his parents, and Doraemon's firm eyes, he finally gritted his teeth and persevered. After coming out, his body and mind were refreshed, and his eyes were more mature and confident.

The final battle took place in front of the Dark Saiyan's aerial fortress. Trunks took the lead and unleashed his full strength to confront the enemy head-on. Doraemon used the Anywhere Door and props to support him, creating chaos from all directions and trying to suppress the enemy's space-time ability. But the Dark Saiyan was too powerful, and Trunks alone could not suppress it, let alone defeat it. Just as Trunks was about to be knocked down, Nobita put on the copy cloak, broke through the fear and jumped down from the sky. His fist burned with golden flames, aiming directly at the enemy's heart.

The time stop device was activated at the critical moment, and the world fell into a standstill. Nobita used these short five seconds to approach the enemy's blind spot. He concentrated all his strength and punched through the energy core of the Dark Saiyan, triggering a huge energy recoil. The Dark Saiyan screamed and turned into shattered light. The black fog in the sky instantly dissipated, and the sun fell on the earth again. Trunks fell to the ground, looking at the once cowardly boy in front of him, and smiled with relief. He knew that this time, it was Nobita who saved the world.

After the war, the future world began to recover, plants grew again, and humans rebuilt their homes. When Trunks said goodbye, he held Nobita's hand tightly and said, "You are the most special warrior I have ever seen." Doraemon was also proud of Nobita, saying that he had finally grown up. The three stood on the hill, looking at the bright horizon in the distance, and felt a peace they had never felt before. Afterwards, Doraemon and Nobita took a time machine back to their own era, and everything seemed to have returned to peace.

After returning to the present, Nobita seemed to have become a different person. He no longer complained easily and no longer evaded responsibility. He finished his homework seriously, helped his mother buy groceries, and even took the initiative to practice sports. Doraemon was so surprised that he was speechless. He knew that this was not a whim, but the result of Nobita's true inner growth. Nobita sometimes stared at the sky in a trance, as if he could still see the ruins and hope of rebirth in the future world. He would not say it, but he would always remember that battle in his heart.

A few days later, a picture suddenly appeared on the TV news: a blond boy repelled a runaway robot on the street, which attracted the attention and speculation of the citizens. Nobita put down his textbook and looked at Doraemon, and they smiled knowingly. Maybe Trunks is back, or maybe a new enemy is approaching. The adventure has never really ended, and they are already ready. No matter how turbulent time and space are, they will always fight side by side.
